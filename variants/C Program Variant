RPN Calculator – Assignment 1.1 (Variant 1)
Author: Daniel Aldama
Course: CPSI38303

This version of the RPN calculator uses recursion to evaluate the stack instead of looping through it. It also does a better job of catching errors in the input if the expression is invalid or malformed

To compile:
  make

To run:
  ./rpn

Of the multiple solutions for this assignment I chose to go with this one.
